# RayTracing

Hello! this GitHub repo serves as a front to present my BSc project on "Scene Rendering using Ray Tracing (Iterative)".
In this 'README.md' file, I will explain fully the concepts related to ray tracing, and the steps to replicate the project.

# Resources

Luckily for us, there is an abundance of resources for ray tracing since its first implementation in 1982:

For the purposes of this project, we will be using the following:

'''
Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series: https://raytracing.github.io/
'''

We are applying ray tracing techniques from this book series in real time scenarios, as opposed to a program which simply writes pixels to a file.

The source content will be similar, but we will also implement and use triangles which can later be used to render 3D meshes.

Tools:
- C++
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2022: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
- Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
