# RayTracing

Hello! This GitHub repo serves as a front to present my BSc project on "Scene Rendering using Ray Tracing".
In this `README.md` file, I will explain fully the concepts related to ray tracing, and the steps to replicate the project.

# Section 0 - Resources

Luckily for us, there is an abundance of resources for ray tracing since its first implementation in 1982:

For the purposes of this project, we will be using the following:
- Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series <br> https://raytracing.github.io/
- Physically Based Rendering, From Theory to Implementation <br> https://www.pbr-book.org/

We are applying ray tracing techniques from the former book series in real time scenarios, as opposed to a program which simply writes pixels to a file.
The source content will be similar, but we will also implement and use triangles which can later be used to render 3D meshes.

Tools:
- C++
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2022 <br> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
- Vulkan SDK <br> https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
